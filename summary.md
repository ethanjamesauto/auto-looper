# Summary
An audio looper pedal that allows a musician to record and layer audio tracks in real time. Audio looper pedals are rarely built as DIY projects due to the large amount of RAM required (around 40-80Kb per second of audio), but this project uses PSRAM (Pseudo-static RAM) and an RP2040-based controller to store up to 32Mb of audio data.
